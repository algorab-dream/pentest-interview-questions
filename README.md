# Pentest interview questions

This is a non exhaustive list of questions that can be asked during pentetration tester technical interview. Being able to provide full and detailed answers to all of those questions should be a good preparation for those interviews.

## What is an XSS ?

An XSS (Cross Site Scripting) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to run custom script in the context of a victim browser. These vulnerabilities arise when the user input is not properly filtered, and can lead to session or data stealing, or more generaly to perform any action the victim is allowed to do on the vulnerable application.

## What is a SQL injection ?

A SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to perform queries against the database by using unsanitized query parameters. This can allow the attacker to read the database, but could also allow to write into the database, to write files or even to execute commands.

## Explain Kerberos protocol and some attacks on it.

The Kerberos protocol is an authentication protocol that relies on a ticket-based authentication. It is maily used in Active Directory environments. Here is the all protocol for accessing a service:

#### AS_REQ - Authentication Server Request
The client sends its username, and a timestamp encrypted using user's hash. The domain controller, acting as a KDC, also maintains the Authentication Server service. 
When recieving the request, it looks up the password hash of the user in the `ntds.dit` and decrypts the timestamp. If the decryption is successful and the timestamp is valid, the authentication is successful.

#### AS_REP - Authentication Server Reply
The Authentication Server replies with a session key and a Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT). The session key is encrypted using user's hash. The TGT contains information regarding the user, the timestamp, the domain, the IP address of the client, and the session key. This ticket is encrypted using `krbtgt` account hash. Only the KDC can decrypt this ticket.
The TGT is valid for a certain amount of time, and can be renewed without needing the user to authenticate again.

#### TGS_REQ - Ticket-Granting-Server Request
The client contacts again the KDC in order to access ressources of the domain. It sends its username with a timestamp encrypted with the session key, the name of the ressource it wishes to access, and the encrypted TGT.
The KDC checks that the ressource exists and decrypts the TGT. The session key is extracted from the decrypted TGT and used to decrypt the timestamp of the request and the username. The KDC checks that the timestamp is valid, the usernames from the TGT and from the TGS_REQ match, and that the client IP address matches the IP address from the TGT. If all those checks pass, the request is valid.

#### TGS_REP - Ticket-Granting-Server Reply
The KDC replies with a packet containing the name of the service for which accesss has been granted, a session key to be used between the client and the service, and a service ticket containing the username, group memberships and the newly-created session key.
The service name and the session key are encrypted using session key associated with the TGT, whereas service ticket itself is encrypted using the hash of the service account registered with this service.

#### AP_REQ - Application Request
Now, the client send a request to the application server, including username and timestamp encrypted with the session key, and the service ticket. The application server decrypts the service ticket with the service account password hash, and extracts the username and the session key. It then uses the session key to decrypt username and timstamp from the request. If the usernames match, the request is valid, and the service checks that user is allowed to access it, and assigns appropriate permissions to the user.

#### Kerberoasting and ASREProasting
The two main attacks against Kerberos protocol are Kerberoasting and ASREProasting.
Kerberoasting occurs when a service account has a predictable password. An authenticated user can issue a service ticket for the service linked to this account, and try to decrypt the service ticket offline by bruteforcing the service account password.
ASREProasting occurs when an account does not need Kerberos preauthentication, which is sending the AS_REQ to get the AS_REP. Then, anyone can get a session key encrypted with user's hash, and then perform offline bruteforce to retrieve the password.

## Explain NTLM protocol

NTLM is used when a client authenticates using a server IP instead of its hostname, or when the hostname is not registered in the AD DNS server.

First step, the client computes an NTLM hash from the user's password. Then, it sends its username to the server, and the server replies with a nonce, which is random. Then, the client encrypts the nonce with its hash, and sends it to the server. The server forwards the response, the nonce and the username to the DC, which checks if the decrypted nonce matches the one sent by the server using user's hash. It then replies to the application server.  

## NTLMv1 vs NTLMv2 ?

NTLMv2 includes a timestamp in the request send by the client including its username, and the nonce has a random length, whereas it is 16-bytes long for NTLMv1. These changes help mitigating relay attacks.

## What is JWT and how to attack it ?

JWT stands for JSON Web Token. This is a self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON objects. It is made of 3 parts. The first one (header) contains signature and cryptographic information. The second (payload) contains claims. The third (signature) contains signature itself. This is often used to contain session and user non confidential informations, and used as a session token. This is widely used in SSO authentication systems.

Here are some ways JWT can be attacked:
- Changing the algorithm to "none"
- Changing the algorithm RS256 to HS256 and use the public key as signing key
- Check for token expiry validation
- Various attacks with `kid`: Path traversal, OS injection, SQL injection ...
- Bruteforce secret key

## What is a XXE ?

XML External Entity is a web vulnerability that allows an attacker to attack an application processing XML data. It can be used to read arbitrary files, or to perform SSRF, by adding an XML entity to the data.

## What are the security HTTP cookie flags ?

HostOnly, HttpOnly, Secure

## Explain 3 way TCP handshake

First: The client sends a SYN packet to the server.
Second: The server replies with a SYN/ACK packet.
Third: The client replies with an ACK packet.

## How does serialization work ? How can it be exploited ? Give examples in at least two different languages/formats.

Serialization is a mechanism that allows to convert an object into a format that can be preserved and reused later. This allows to recreate an object with same propreties later. This process is called deserialization. Deserialization can be exploited if the attacker can manipulate serialized data to craft malicious objects.

For instance, PHP serialization can be exploited through the `__wakeup` or the `__destruct` methods.
Python `pickle` serialization can also be exploited with the `__reduce__` method.


## What is a CSRF ? How to protect from it ?

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a web attack that allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of users by using their authenticated sessions. This is done by tricking the user to perform a request on the web application, for instance by automatically submitting a form.

To protect from it, CSRF tokens can be used, which are unique tokens linked ot each session and requested on each request. Cross-origin ressource sharing (CORS) policy can also be enhanced. Finally, modifying parameters names can also help preventing this attack.

## Can SSTI lead to RCE ?

Yes, for instance with Jinja in python, it is possible to access the `os` module and from there execute shell commands.

## What is OWASP Top 10 ? Give some entries of the top.

OWASP Top 10 is a list representing the 10 most critical security risks to web applications. Last update of the list was in 2021. It contains vulnerabilities like Broken Access Control, Cryptographic Failures, Injections or SSRF.

## What is the difference between symetric and assymetric encryption ? Pros/cons ?

Symmetric uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, whereas assymetric uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
Symmetric encryption's advantage is that the computations are faster than assymetric encryption. However, assymetric encryption is more secure as knowing how to encrypt a message does not need to know how to decrypt it.

## What is the difference between hash and encryption ?

A hash is a one-way mathematical operation that generates a fixed-length fingerprint vor variable-length input data. Each fingerprint is unique, and allows to check whether two chunks of data match or not.
Encryption is used to transform a readable plaintext into a unreadable ciphertext using a mathematical operation and an encryption key. It can then be decrypted, by knowing the decryption key.

## How would you define a risk ? A vulnerability ?

Cybersecurity risk is the potential harm resulting from a cyber attack or a data breach, and the consequences it can have on information systems, reputation, individuals, organizational operations or other organizations.
A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.

## What is CVSS ?

CVSS stands for Common Vulnerability Scoring System and is a tool provided by the NIST in order to better assess a vulnerability, based on its complexity, impact, and other criteria.

## What are the different TCP flags ?

- SYN: Used to initiate a communication
- ACK: Used to acknowledge recieved packets
- FIN: Used to request connection termination
- RST: Used to terminate connection if something seems wrong
- URG: Used to indicate data in this packet should be prioritized
- PSH: Used to request immediate data delivery without waiting for additionnal data to be buffered

## What is a SSRF ?

A SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) is a vulnerability that allows the attacker to send requests from the server. This can allow an attacker to access internal network, internal-only services, files, or to bypass host restrictions.

## What is an Open Redirect ?

An open redirection is a web vulnerability that allows an attacker to redirect the client to any arbitraty external domain through user input.

## What are common file uploads restrictions and how to bypass them ?

Common restrictions are:
- Extension based checks
- MIME type based checks
- Magic bytes based checks

In order to bypass those checks, an attacker can use multiple extensions, can change the MIME type on the request, or can craft polyglot files for example.

## What are the different types of XSS vulnerabilities ?

- Stored XSS: the payload is stored in the server side and is therefore persistent
- Reflected XSS: the payload comes from the request, and can only be triggered this way
- DOM XSS: the payload is processed by client-side JavaScript in an unsafe way
- Self XSS: the attack can only be performed by the victim itself by performing specific actions
- Server-side XSS: the payload is executed by the server when processing user input in an unsafe way

## What is an error blind SQLi ?

Blind means the attacker cannot see the result of the injection. Then, it is possible to instead perform queries that will raise an error depending on the result of a condition. If the attacker can distinguish between a successful query and an error, it is then possible to recover data.

## Explain the CIA triad

- Confidentiality: Only authorized parties can access the data
- Integrity: The data cannot be modified by a unauthorized party
- Availability: The data is always accessible to authorized parties

## What is a Buffer Overflow ?

A Buffer Overflow is a executable vulnerability that arises when the provided input is too big to fit in the allocated space for it, resulting in overwriting the program memory. This can result to arbitrary code execution in the context of the executable. 

## What is a Business Logic vulnerability ?

Business logic vulnerabilities are web application vulnerabilities based on flaws in the design or in the implementation of the application, that results in unintended behavior.

## What is AppArmor ? How does it work (briefly) ?

AppArmor is a Linux kernel-based security framework that provides mandatory access control for applications. It works by confining the behavior of an application to a specific profile, which defines what the application can and cannot do.

## What are the most common HTTP methods ?

- GET: Retrieves a resource from the server.
- POST: Submits data to be processed by the server.
- HEAD: Retrieves metadata about a resource, similar to GET, but without the response body.
- OPTIONS: Returns the HTTP methods supported by the server for a specific URL.

## What is a salt ?

A salt is a value that is appended to the password before hashing it in order to prevent the use of rainbow tables or any precomputed hash lists.

## What is 0x90 ?

`0x90` represent a NOP in machine code. This is an instruction nothing, and that is used in binary exploitation to construct NOP-slides to make sure that, not matter where the return pointer ends, it still ends up executing the shellcode.

## What is a forest ?

A forest is a collection of one or more Active Directory domains that share a common logical structure, directory schema (class and attribute definitions), directory configuration (site and replication information), and global catalog (forest-wide search capabilities). Domains in the same forest are automatically linked with two-way, transitive trust relationships.

## Explain how a Linux system boots, from pressing the power on button to login screen.

#### BIOS phase
1. The BIOS checks verify that hardware is present and functionning by performing a POST (Power On Self Test)
2. The BIOS checks the configured boot order to find a bootable device
3. The BIOS checks the MBR table of the bootable device to find the location of the bootloader

#### Bootloader
A bootloader is a program that loads the operating system in memory. The most common bootloader is GRUB.

1. The bootloader presents a list of all operating systems
2. The bootloader decompresses the Linux kernel into memory
3. The bootloader loads an initial RAM disk (initrd or initramfs), that contains tools and kernel modules needed to mount the root filesystem
4. The initramfs executes the initial process (usually /sbin/init), which loads additional drivers, mounts filesystems, and prepare the system for the real root filesystem
5. The initramfs switches to the root filesystem

#### Kernel
1. The kernel spawns the init process, which is now usually systemd
2. The init process will spawn all other background processes, depending on the configuration

## What is a Use-After-Free vulnerability ?

A Use-After-Free vulnerability is an executable vulnerability that arises when a program continues to access a memory location after it has been freed, or deallocated. This can result to unexpected behaviour, crashes or even security vulnerabilities.

## What happens on the network when I plug my Ethernet wire ?

`TODO`

## How would you remotely access a service that can only be accessed from within an internal network ?

Setting up a SSH tunnel is a solution. If there are traffic restrictions, it is also possible to setup a HTTP tunnel with chisel or a DNS tunnel with dnscat or iodine.

## What is the difference between an OU and a Group ?

Organizational units are used to delegate administrative rights and apply group policy settings, whereas groups are employed to manage permissions.

- Organizational units can encompass group policy objects (GPOs), while AD groups cannot.
- Organizational units can delegate admin rights, but AD groups cannot.
- AD groups can manage permissions, while organizational units cannot.
- AD groups possess their own security identifier (SID), whereas organizational units do not.

## What is a Windows Access Token ?

An access token holds security information for each logon session. It identifies the user, its groups, its privileges and the SID that identifies the current logon session. Ecery process created on behalf of the user has a copy of that token. 

## What is the UAC ?

The UAC (User Access Control) is a Windows security feature that reduces the risk of malware by limiting the ability of malicious code to execute with administrator privileges. Each application that requires the administrator access token must prompt the end user for consent, and ask for administrator credentials.

## What is an HMAC ?

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a signature algorithm involving a secret key and a hash function. It allows to verify both integrity and authenticity of a message.

## How can you quickly escape from a Docker environment ?

By looking if the docker socket is mounted. If so, it is possible to run regular docker commands.

## What is the difference between containers and virtualization ?

Each virtual machine runs its own guest OS, and ressources such as CPU, memory and storage are allocated to each VM. Containers run on top of the host OS, and ressources are shared between containers.

## What is a Pass the Hash attack ?

A Pass the Hash attack consists on authenticating to a system (usually a Domain Controller) by using the hash of the account instead of the password. As hashes are used instead of password in Kerberos and NTLM protocols, knowing the hash is enough to be able to authenticate.

## How do you manually test for Linux privilege escalation ? For Windows ?

#### Linux
- Check current user privileges
- Check all users
- Checking sudo rights for current user
- Find interesting readable files
- Check all SUID and GUID executables
- Monitor cron jobs using `pspy` or by reading `/etc/cron`...
- Check current PATH
- Determine if system is a container or a virtual machine
- Check open ports, to find potential internal-only open ports
- Check running services and processes and their permissions
- Check network interfaces and routes

#### Windows
- Check current user privileges, groups
- Check current tokens that could be abused
- Check all users
- Find interesting readable files
- Check current user's history
- Check environment variables
- Check open ports, to find potential internal-only open ports
- Check running services and processes and their permissions (unquoted path, dll hijacking, etc)
- Check network interfaces and routes
- Check for kernel/installed binaries known vulnerabilities

## What is Mimikatz ? What is it used for ?

Mimikatz is a tool used on Windows exploitation. It can be used to extract password plaintext or hashes, to extract and forge kerberos tickets, and perform pass-the-hash and pass-the-ticket attacks.

## Where are all accounts data located in an Active Directory ?

They are located in the ntds.dit file, stored on the Domain Controller.

## What is inside /etc/passwd ?

Inside /etc/passwd are informations about users: their username, their uid and gid, their home directory and their login shell. Passwords can be also added in /etc/passwd, but this would be a serious security flaw, as it is world-readable.

## What are the phases of a pentest ?

- Reconnaissance: gathering as much information as possible about the target
- Scanning: identify open ports and running services, check traffic
- Vulnerability assessment: identify potential vulnerabilities
- Exploitation: attempt to exploited potential vulnerabilities
- Reporting: document findings on a penetration test report 

## What is TLS ? SSL ?

TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Socket Layer) are two cryptographic protocols that encrypt session and authenticate data during a communication. SSL is a deprecated protocol with known vulnerabilities, and TLS is nowadays used instead. Its latest version is 1.3.
Both protocols use certificates (names SSL certificates) that both authenticate the server and let encrypt data, using assymetric encryption.

## What is XPath injection ?

XPath injection occurs when a web application uses user input to construct an XPath query for XML data. Similarly to SQL injection, that kind of injection can be used to access data the attacker may not be able to access, or to bypass an authentication mechanism for example.

## What is SSL stripping ? How to prevent it ?

SSL stripping is an attack that downgrades HTTPS connections to plain HTTP connections. This is performed by the attacker by being in a man-in-the-middle configuration, and intercept and downgrade the connection before forwarding it to the victim. This attack can be prevented by using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which instructs the browser to only accept HTTPS communication for that website.

## What is certificate pinning ?

Certificate Pinning is a security mechanism that helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring that only trusted certificates can be presented by a server or application. The application keeps a copy of the certificate, which is compared with the connection certificate to determine whether the connection is secure or not.

## What to do when you find hashes ?

It can be possible to bruteforce them offline, using tool such as JohnTheRipper or hashcat, with an adapted dictionnary (for instance, rockyou) and an adapted set of rules.
In the context of Active Directory, it can also be possible to pass the hash, and be able to login as the user.

## What happens on the network when I request https://www.google.com/ with my web browser ?

We suppose all DNS tables of all machines are empty.

- The computer checks its DNS table to see if www.google.com is registered. We suppose it isn't
- The computer asks the DNS server (usually the router DNS server) for the IP adress associated with www.google.com through a DNS request
- The router looks in his DNS table to see if www.google.com is registered. We suppose the DNS table 
- The router requests its DNS recursive resolver
- The DNS recursive resolver requests a DNS root nameserver to get the TLD (Top Level Domain) DNS server, here `.com`
- The resolver then requests the `.com` TLD server to get the IP adress of the domain's nameserver, here `google.com`
- The resolver requests the domain's nameserver to get the IP adress of the `www` subdomain
- Then, the resolver gives the IP adress to the router, which updates its DNS tables and forwards it to the machine, which can also update its DNS tables
- Now that the computer has the IP adress, it establishes a TCP connection followed by a TLS connection with the server
- Then, it send a GET request over that connection to the server
- Finally, the server replies with an HTTP 200 response

## How does NTLM relay attack work ?

In an NTLM relay attack, the victim tries to authenticate with the NTLM protocol to the attacker. The attacker forwards the request to the server, and forwards back the nonce to the victim. The victim then sends the encrypted challenge to the attacker, which forwards it to the server and then gets authenticated as the victim.

## What is a LFI ?

An LFI (Local File Inclusion) is a web application vulnerability that allows an attacker to include an arbitrary local file in the application.

## How could you attack a FTP service ?

By looking for anonymous login. If this is allowed or if credentials are provided, it can also be possible to perform FTP bounce using the PORT command, which can allow to communicate to other servers and services.

## What is Broken Access Control vulnerability ?

Broken Access Control is a web application vulnerability that allows an attacker to access data or perform actions it should be allowed to with its current privileges.

## Explain what services run on these ports : 21, 22, 25, 53, 80, 88, 161, 389, 443, 445, 587, 1433, 3306, 3389, 5985, 6379, 25565

- 21: FTP
- 22: SSH
- 25: SMTP
- 53: DNS
- 80: HTTP
- 88: Kerberos
- 161: SNMP

- 1433: MSSQL
- 3306: MySQL
- 3389: RDP
- 5985: WinRM
- 6379: Redis
- 25565: Minecraft (Actually no need to remember this one, was just to see if you were focused)

## What is clickjacking ?

Clickjacking is a web application attack where the victim is tricked into clicking on an element of the webpage that is either invisible or disguised as another element.

## What is a race condition ?

A race condition is a bug that can occur when multiple processes are accessing the same ressource simultaneously, resulting into unexpected behaviour. This can be exploited by attackers to bypass security checks, or to elevate privileges. That can of bug can happen in many contexts, from executables to web applications.

## What is SAML ?

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is a standardized way to tell external applications and services that a user is who they say they are. SAML makes single sign-on (SSO) technology possible by providing a way to authenticate a user once and then communicate that authentication to multiple applications. The most current version of SAML is SAML 2.0.

## AES-CBC vs AES-ECB ?

AES-ECB encrypts each block independently, whereas AES-CBC encrypts each block using the result of previous block encryption. Therefore, two blocks with the same content will be different for AES-CBC but not for AES-ECB.

## What is the principle of least privilege ?

The principle of least privilege is a fundamental concept in computer security that aims to minimize the attack surface by limiting the privileges and access rights of users, processes, or services to only what is necessary for their legitimate purposes.

## How to rate a vulnerability ?

A vulnerability can be rated depending on its complexity, its impact, its vector or the required privileges to exploit it. Many frameworks such as CVSS helps to rate a vulnerability.

## What is the difference between an IDS and an IPS ?

An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) helps to detect and monitor intrusions. An IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) can on the other hand take actions and stop the traffic until investigation is done. An IDS is passive, whereas an IPS is active.

## Explain the full process of ARP spoofing attack.

`TODO`

## What algorithm are Windows and Linux using for hashing passwords ?

- Linux nowadays uses the `yescrypt` algorithm, but also used to use bcrypt, MD5, SHA256, SHA512 and even DES.
- Windows uses NTLM algorithm.

## Where are cron jobs stored ?

- For Linux, system-wide cron jobs are located in the `/etc/crontab` file and in the `/etc/cron.d` directory. User's cron jobs are located in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs`.

## What is a golden ticket attack ? How can it be achieved ?

A golden ticket attack consists on the attacker being able to craft its own TGT, allowing the access to any service as any user. This can be achieved by accessing the `krbtgt` account password hash, that is used to encrypt the TGT during Kerberos authentication.

## What is an IDOR ?

Insecure direct object references (IDOR) are a type of access control vulnerability that arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly. For example, a web application allowing to access user information by using an id parameter could be vulnerable if the application does not check that the logged-in user matches the requested one.

## How can you prevent online and offline bruteforce attacks ?

- Online: by implementing rate limiting or by adding artificial delay on log-in attempts
- Offline : by using strong hashing algorithms, such as bcrypt, with a salt

## What is a Zone Tranfer attack ?

DNS Zone transfers are used by primary and secondary DNS servers to update zone files and records. By default, DNS zone transfer offers no authentication, which means that an attacker could request for a zone tranfer and access the list of all hosts for a particular domain.

## What is a GPO ?

A Group Policy Object (GPO) is a virtual collection of policy settings. A GPO has a unique name, such as a GUID.

## What is an Unquoted Service Path ?

In Windows, an unquoted service path is a service whose executable path contains spaces and is not quoted. Because of how Windows parses a command, the system tries to execute the path at each space. If an attacker can write a file whose name is the name of one of the pathes before the targeted executable, it can be possible to execute any binary on behalf of the user running the service.
